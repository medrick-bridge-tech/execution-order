## Introduction
**When a Unity script runs, number of events & functions executes in order. In this repository we will learn about those execution orders.**

## First Scene Load

**These functions get called when a scene starts**

- **Awake:** Before any start functions and just after prefab is instantiated, it is called.
    - If a GameObject is inactive during start up, Awake is not called until it is made active.
- **OnEnable:** Only called just after the object is enabled.
---
## Editor

**These functions get called after script set**

- **Reset:** When script is attached to game object, Reset function is called to initialize the scriptâ€™s properties.
- **OnValidate:** It is called when the script is loaded or a value changes in the Inspector. Use OnValidate function to perform an action after a value changes in the Inspector; for example, making sure that data stays within a certain range.
